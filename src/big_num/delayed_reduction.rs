//! DelayedReduction trait for accumulating unreduced field products.
//!
//! Modular reduction (Montgomery REDC) is expensive. When summing many
//! products `sum (field_i * field_j)`, the standard approach does N reductions.
//! Delayed reduction accumulates unreduced products in wide integers, reducing
//! only once at the end.
//!
//! Uses WideLimbs<9> (576-bit) accumulators with a single Montgomery REDC
//! at the end.
