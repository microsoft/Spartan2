//! DelayedReduction trait for accumulating unreduced products.

/// Extension trait for delayed modular reduction operations.
///
/// This trait extends `SmallValueField` with operations that accumulate
/// unreduced products in wide integers, reducing only at the end.
/// Used in hot paths like matrix-vector multiplication where many products
/// are summed together.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// Delaying reduction saves ~1 field multiplication per accumulation:
/// - Without delayed reduction: N additions + N reductions
/// - With delayed reduction: N additions + 1 reduction
