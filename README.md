# Spartan: High-speed zero-knowledge SNARKs without trusted setup
Spartan is a high-speed zkSNARK, where a zkSNARK is type cryptographic proof system that enables a prover to prove a mathematical statement to a verifier with a short proof and succinct verification, and without revealing anything beyond the validity of the statement. Spartan provides a linear-time polynomial IOP that when combined with a polynomial commitment scheme provides a succinct interactive argument. It is made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir transform.

Compared to an earlier implementation of [Spartan](https://github.com/Microsoft/Spartan), this project provides an implementation of Spartan that is generic over the polynomial commitment scheme. This version also accepts circuits expressed with bellpepper, which supports R1CS. In the future, we plan to add support for other circuit formats (e.g., Plonkish, CCS). The proofs are *not* zero-knowledge (we plan to add it in the near future). The first version of this code is derived from Nova's open-source code.

### Supported polynomial commitment schemes

  - [x] Bulletproofs-based PCS
  - [x] Hyrax PCS
  - [ ] HyperKZG (requires a universal trusted setup)
  - [ ] Mercury / Samaritan (require a universal trusted setup)
- [ ] Hash-based schemes
  - [ ] Basefold
  - [ ] WHIR
  - [ ] Brakedown
  - [ ] Binius
  - [ ] Ligero
- [ ] Lattice-based schemes
  - [ ] Greyhound
